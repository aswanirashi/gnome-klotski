  <title>Game rules</title>

  <p>You have to follow some rules while sliding the blocks in order to solve
  <app>Klotski</app>. The rules are listed below:</p>
  <!--Saying "you have to" is a aggressive language for documentation. Rephrase this? To say "These are the rules to follow when sliding blocks..." -->

  <section id="move-block">
    <title>Move a block</title>
      <steps>
        <item><p>Click on the block to be moved.</p></item> 
        <!--There would be no click on a touch screen interface if GNOME were to be used on it. Besides, Click and Drag is the action to make a move right? So combine first and second instruction to say something like "Click and drag and the desired block to a location of your choice on the board" -->
        <item><p>Move the block to the desired location with the help of
        mouse.</p></item>
        <!--mouse? Bring out that checklist please. Doesn't it not say that all help instructions should be system agnostic? Rephrase this.-->
        <item><p>Click on the block again.</p></item>
        <!--If you combine first and second instuctions, this one won't be required -->
      </steps>
  </section>


<!-- This section should be placed first and then "Move a block" section. -->
 <section id="rules">
   <title>Rules to move a block</title>
     <list>
      <!-- Language is a bit negative for documentation. Try to say something like "The green blocks and boundary blocks cannot be moved. A block cannot be moved over the green blocks. However, it is allowed to move a patterend block. Only a single step is allowed in one move.-->
       <item><p>You can not move the green blocks and the boundary
       blocks.</p></item>
       <item><p>You can not move over a block with the exception that the
       patterned block can move across the green blocks.</p></item>
       <item><p>You can take more than one step in a single move.</p></item>
