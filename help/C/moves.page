  <title>Moves</title>

  <p>You can see your number of moves at the top of the game screen. The 
  consecutive moves of a block are considered to be a single move. For example,
  moving a block up one square then right two squares is considered one
  move.</p>

    <title>Goal piece moves</title>
      <p>The goal location may be positioned slightly off the board. The
      goal piece, which is the patterned block, is always permitted to move to
      it. However, no other blocks are permitted to move off the board</p>
