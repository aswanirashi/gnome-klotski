  <title>Moves</title>
<!-- starting the setence with "The" is not correct, revise -->
  <p>The consecutive moves of a block are considered to be a single move. For
  example, moving a block up one square then right two squares is considered one
  move.</p>

    <title>Goal piece moves</title>
      <p>The goal location may be positioned slightly off the board. The
      goal piece, which is the patterned block, is always permitted to move to
      it. However, no other blocks are permitted to move off the board.</p>
